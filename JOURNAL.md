# June 23rd: Initial conception and part sourcing.

Initial conception of the idea: an easy way for theatre techs to check wether xlr cables work.

After a bit of brainstorming, heres the BOM I arrived at:

**Total:** $56.44  
**Total (inc. Shipping):** $75.32

Yes, I know the ES8388 is expensive, I'm going to do some more digging over the next few days for some alternatives.

Anyway, this is my first time doing anything to do with pcb's and the like, I normally code my way out of problems. So we'll see how it goes.

With that being said, I'm onto wiring and modelling tomorrow.

Thanks for following along,

Josh
